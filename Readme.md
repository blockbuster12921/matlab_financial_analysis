# Financial Analysis with MATLAB

## Convert categorical variables to dummy variables
Because some functions such as corr(), ridge() and lassoglm() cannot deal with categorical predictors

## GLS
Estimate a logistical model using the trainTbl (i.e., contains categorical variables)

## Stepwise regression models
Fit a stepwise regression model using only the top10 predictors you have found in the covariance analysis above.

## Lasso
Model estimation using training data lasso cannot handle categorical predictors

## Elastic Net
Do the same analysis as you did with the lasso, but use the elastic net model with alpha parameter set to 0.5.
